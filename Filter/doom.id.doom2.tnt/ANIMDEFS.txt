//This is here to bypass an issue in this mod that has arisen due to the way TNT makes use of th WFALL patches.

//An explanation as to why this was necessary:
//The original Doom II executable had unused code to animate any patches between the names of WFALL1 and WFALL4. Waterfall
//textures were created during the game's development (later used in this mod), but were never used nor included in the final
//game. The Plutonia Experiment, as well as some later Doom PWADs, implement patches which use the code. TNT, however, takes
//advantage of this by using 512x128 patches containing multiple textures (Namely an activated skull switch, a switch and a
//lever with what appears to be a forcefield, hacked/malfunctioning computer panels, and a proper waterfall, in that order).
//Previously, GamingMarine in Doom would override TNT's WFALL patches and always display a waterfall, regardless of what was
//actually used in the original game. With this filtered lump, the mod will now respect the original patches if GZDoom detects
//that the user is playing TNT.
//(Speaking of which, due to the way this filter had to be done, this fix will only work in newer versions of GZDoom. Sorry,
//Zandronum users. :\)
