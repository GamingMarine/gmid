What is GamingMarine in Doom?

GamingMarine in Doom is a mod that asks the question, "How insane can a mod about its creator get without making everything overpowered?"
In this mod, you play as GamingMarine, the youngest marine employed at the Union Aerospace Corporation, fighting in a war against a non-human cult known as the Master Force.
This mod includes a 16 year old with a Duke Nukem-esque attitude, a female cacodemon you can summon to fight alongside you, references to various classic arcade games, and plenty of easter eggs.
The games that GamingMarine in Doom supports (As of right now) is Doom, Doom II, The Ultimate Doom, Final Doom, Master Levels, No Rest for the Living, both FreeDoom phases, and The People's Doom.
